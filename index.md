* Lab 04: Hi-Lo Game

    One of my favorite projects was Lab 4, Part 2, where we wrote a program for guessing a secret number and another person had to guess it in 2 tries. This lab for me was a little challenging at first but then it got easier. I learned to use if statements which helped me in future labs and was also a fun project to work on.



* Lab 05: Command-Line Mad Libs

    Another of my favorite projects was Lab 5, Part 1 because it was game related which made it interesting to work on. In this lab, I learned how to use command-line arguments to create a mad libs that builds a sandwich, which was fun to work on. These labs were challenging which is something that I like since they helped me learn these concepts.



* Lab 07: Multi-Turn Hi-Lo Game

    My third favorite project was Lab 7, Part 1 which was to write a program for a multi-turn hi-lo game. Compared to the hi-lo game in lab 4, lab 7 utilized command-line arguments, if statements, and loops so that the person guessing would have a max of five guesses instead of two. I used command-line arguments and learned to use for loops so it could go through however times are specified which I struggled with in the beginning.
